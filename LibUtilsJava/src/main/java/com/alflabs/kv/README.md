# LibUtils KV Client and KV Server

## What is it

__LibUtils KV__ is a key-value network server client.

The server publishes simple key/value pairs and automatically synchronizes
changed values between the server and all clients.

Non-goals: the network protocol is not secured; there's no
authentication between nodes; traffic is not encrypted, nor compressed.
It's designed to run on a trusted local closed network.


## Distribution
