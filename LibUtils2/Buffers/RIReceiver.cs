	/// <summary>
	/// The RIReceiver interface describes the counterpart
	/// to RISender, that is an entity that can receive
	/// notifications when a sender has new buffers available.
	/// 
	/// See full comments in RISender's class description.
	/// 
	/// RIReceiver derived classes do not actually "receive"
	/// buffers. They are only notified when a sender
	/// produces new buffers. The implementation here is
	/// responsible for grabbing the buffers when appropriate
	/// with the only guaranteed rule that at least one buffer
	/// will be made available.
	/// Implementations should also be careful in locking the
	/// sender's queue when dequeuing buffers.
	/// 
	/// Here are various strategies to implement the callback:
	/// - The receiver can immediately access the sender's queue
	///   (lock it, get the buffer and release the lock) and then
	///   immediately process the buffer. This is straightforward 
	///   to implement but has the inconvenience of blocking
	///   the sender. Also beware that this executes in the 
	///   working thread of the sender.
	/// - The receiver can dequeue buffers from the sender 
	///   and enqueue them in its own private queue for later
	///   asynchronous processing. This assumes the receiver has
	///   its own worker thread which repeatedly pools its
	///   internal queue or an internal asynchronous timer.
	/// - The receiver can simply set a signal. In its worker
	///   thread the receiver can then lock on signal. When the
	///   signal is set, the worker thread unsets it, dequeues
	///   buffers from the sender's queue and process them till
	///   the queue is exhausted. The sender queue should only be
	///   locked in the minimal amount of time it takes to dequeue
	///   one buffer.
	/// </summary>
