	/// <summary>
	/// The RISender interface describes an entity that
	/// can produce data in the form of RBuffer instances.
	/// 
	/// The sender doesn't actually "send" any data.
	/// Instead it provides a buffer queue and can send
	/// a notification to am RIReceiver when new data is
	/// available. The receiver will be responsible for
	/// extracting the data from the queue.
	/// 
	/// The only mandatory rule here is that once a receiver
	/// received a notification, it must be able to fetch at
	/// least one data buffer from the sender queue.
	/// 
	/// The sender does not need to have as many queued
	/// data buffer as notifications sent. The notification
	/// merely indicate that at least one data buffer is
	/// available.
	/// This way, a receiver may choose to either pool
	/// the sender's queue repeatedly, or on the other
	/// hand it may choose to drop notification events
	/// if it doesn't need data, or to just keep a note
	/// that some data can be fetched at a later time.
	/// 
	/// Consequently, depending on the nature of the queue
	/// being managed, it may be up to the sender to remove
	/// obsolete queued buffers that have not be used yet.
	/// </summary>
